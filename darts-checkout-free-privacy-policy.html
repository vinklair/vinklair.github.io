        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>This Privacy Policy describes how Darts Checkout app (“we,” “us,” or “our”) collects, uses, and shares information about you when you use our mobile application (“App”). By using the App, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.</p>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

        <h3>a. Non-Personal Data</h3>
        <p><strong>Usage and Diagnostics Information:</strong> We use Firebase Analytics and Firebase Crashlytics to collect data on how you interact with the App. This may include information such as which features you use, how often you use them, crash reports, and performance metrics. This information is used to improve the App’s functionality and stability.</p>
        <p><strong>Advertising Identifiers:</strong> We use Google Mobile Ads (AdMob) to serve ads. AdMob may collect device identifiers (such as the Advertising Identifier on iOS), app interaction information, and approximate location information to deliver personalized or contextual ads, depending on your settings.</p>

        <h3>b. Local Data Storage</h3>
        <p><strong>Game Scores and Settings:</strong> Any results from the subtraction and addition games, as well as other user preferences, are stored locally on your device using UserDefaults. This information is not sent to our servers or any third parties.</p>

        <h3>c. In-App Purchase Information</h3>
        <p><strong>Transaction Data:</strong> When you make an in-app purchase (e.g., to remove banner ads), Apple processes your payment information. We receive a transaction confirmation but do not have access to your credit card number or other sensitive financial details. We only store non-personal purchase validation data provided by Apple to ensure the feature remains unlocked.</p>

        <h2>2. How We Use the Information</h2>
        <p><strong>Analytics and Improvements:</strong> We use non-personal usage and diagnostic data to understand user behavior, identify and fix bugs, improve performance, and enhance the user experience.</p>
        <p><strong>Advertising:</strong> AdMob uses collected data to display relevant advertisements. You can opt out of personalized ads by adjusting your device’s advertising settings.</p>
        <p><strong>In-App Purchases:</strong> Information related to your purchase is used solely for enabling and maintaining the purchased features (e.g., removing ads).</p>

        <h2>3. How We Share Your Information</h2>
        <p>We do not share your personal information with third parties for their own marketing purposes. We may share non-personal information with our analytics and advertising partners as part of using their SDKs. These partners include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Firebase (by Google): For analytics and crash reporting.</li>
            <li>AdMob (by Google): For serving and optimizing ads.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Please consult their privacy policies for details on their data handling:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy" target="_blank">Firebase Privacy Policy</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google Privacy Policy</a></li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
        <p>We take commercially reasonable measures to protect your information. However, no security measure can be guaranteed to be 100% effective, and we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you provide.</p>

        <h2>5. Children’s Privacy</h2>
        <p>Our App is not directed toward children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, please contact us, and we will take steps to delete it as required by applicable law.</p>

        <h2>6. Your Choices</h2>
        <p><strong>Opt-Out of Personalized Ads:</strong> You can opt out of personalized ads through your device’s privacy and advertising settings.</p>
        <p><strong>Analytics Opt-Out:</strong> While we do not currently offer a direct opt-out for analytics and crash reporting, you can limit advertising identifiers at the operating system level and/or refrain from using the App if you are uncomfortable with these measures.</p>

        <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this policy from time to time. When we do, we will revise the “Last Updated” date at the top of this policy. Continued use of the App after changes have been posted indicates your acceptance of those changes.</p>
