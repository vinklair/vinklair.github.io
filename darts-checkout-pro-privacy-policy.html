        <h3>b. Local Data Storage</h3>
        <p><strong>Game Scores and Settings:</strong> Any results from subtraction and addition games, as well as user preferences, are stored locally on your device using UserDefaults. This information is not transmitted to our servers or any third parties.</p>
    
        <h3>c. In-App Purchase Information</h3>
        <p><strong>Transaction Data:</strong> When you purchase the App, Apple processes your payment information. We receive transaction confirmation but do not access your credit card number or other sensitive financial details.</p>
